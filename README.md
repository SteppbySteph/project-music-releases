# Music Releases

In this project we created a website using external data from Spotify which we rendered on the browser using React components.

## The problem

We had difficulties mapping through arrays in a component file but we solved this by following an instruction video. We started to implement the data and structure the components to a given design. With more time we could have added a bit of accessibility design to the website.
